# Learning Linux and Building a Personal VPN

## Overview
This repository documents the progression of my project. It should not contain, or even focus on, the end result or most recent version.
The theme is linux, networking and tunneling work in practice.

## Objectives
Before working on the end result I want to focus on understanding and practicing:
- Linux Fundamentals (Installing Ubuntu and following practice guides)
- Basic networking and VPN concepts (get an intuitive feel for what a VPN actually is)

The project stage should then follow and ask for a README update.

## Technologies Used
- GNU / linux (Ubuntu)
- Wireguard
- Bash scripting
- Git & Github

## Project Structure
- `docs/` - Notes
- `configs/` - Example VPN and firewall configurations
- `scripts/` - Automation scripts
- `diagrams/` - Network architecture visuals

## Status
Ongoing learning project - updated as I document new explorations
