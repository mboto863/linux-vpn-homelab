I wanted to install GNU as a primary OS on my old hp-envy laptop. To guide
me in the installation, and for my first reading, I used the handbook "Learn
Linux for Beginners" by Zaira Hira.

## Linux Distribution
I followed the usual recommendation and picked Ubuntu to improve the learning
experience.
